		<h5>India - Tribute to Martyrs</h5>

		 	<span style="font-weight:400;">Overview: </span> 
		 	Presently the world’s largest democracy with the longest written constitution, India, has been a free and independent nation only since 1947. Earlier being visited by the Aryans, the Persians, Iranians, Parses and Mughals, India was invaded and looted by the Mongolians. Later french colonies were established and finally came the Britishers to rule over the country. India lived under the colonial rule- British Raj for nearly 200 years. After being ruled over by the British East India Company from 1600, the Sepoy mutiny, called The Indian Rebellion of 1857, began. This marked the initiation of the Indian Freedom Struggle. The struggle for freedom wasn’t demanded or fought for in a single day but it took 90 years for the country to regain its political independency and it was a mass based movement. Hundreds of freedom fighters campaigned against foreign domination and helped in getting the country freed from British, French and Portuguese rule. These are many greatest freedom fighters of all time to whom we owe this independent nation we are currently living in.
